# API Directory

This directory contains all backend REST API routes for the project, implemented using Next.js API routes and TypeScript.

- Place route handlers as subfolders/files here (e.g., /app/api/auth/register/route.ts).
- Each route should export the appropriate HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, etc).
